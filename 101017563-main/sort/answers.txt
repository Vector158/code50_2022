sort1 uses:

Selection sort iterates
through the unsorted portions of a list,
selecting the smallest element each time
and moving it to its correct location.

How do you know?:

Random = ~8sec
Reversed = ~8sec
Sorted = 1.15se




sort2 uses:

Merge sort recursively divides the list into two repeatedly
and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger
one in the correct order.

How do you know?:

So far the best overall results.





sort3 uses:

Bubble sort

How do you know?:

Exsclusion principle.





sort1 random = 8sec
sort2        = 0.9sec
sort3        = 3.4sec

sort1 reversed = 8sec
sort2          = 0.78sec
sort3          = 3.65sec

sort1 sorted = 1.15sec
sort2        = 0.72sec
sort3        = 4sec
